# Mushroom Classification 

This project involves classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using a public dataset from Kaggle, the **Mushroom Classification** dataset. We applied various machine learning algorithms to tackle this classification problem and compared their performance to identify the best model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes **8124 samples** of mushrooms with **22 features** for each sample. Each mushroom is classified as either **edible (e)** or **poisonous (p)**.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features. We approach this classification problem using the following models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Ridge Classifier**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Neural Networks**
- **Random Forest (final evaluation)**

Evaluate and compare the performance of each model and identify the best-performing classifier.


## Results

The performance of the models is summarized below based on accuracy:

| **Model**              | **Accuracy** |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 79%          |
| Ridge Classifier        | 79%          |
| Decision Tree           | 90%          |
| Naive Bayes             | 80%          |
| Neural Network          | 86%          |
| Random Forest           | 90%          |

### Best Performing Model

The **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models performed the best with an accuracy of **90%**.
